This app is designed for the convince of crafters everywhere to keep track of task lists. A list with any title can be created and posts can be added with the option to view all lists across all users.

### User Stories

1. A user can create an account
2. Users can choose to use a random avatar
3. Existing users can:
  - Edit/delete their account
  - Create/view their own lists
  - Delete lists from their own view without effecting another user's lists
  - Add a post to any list created
  - Edit/delete only posts they created
  - View another user's lists
4. All lists and posts are views in alphabetical order

### Unsolved problems
1. image_suckr gem doesn't always provide an image
2. the image tag for the post photos still generate even when the attribute is empty
3. evening out the dynamic post divs

### Functionality to implement in later versions

1. sorting by attributes (goal date, creation date, etc)
2. liking posts
3. copying posts to your own lists
4. category creation in a post creation
5. post searching
6. adding comments/tags to posts
